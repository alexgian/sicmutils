    <h1 class="Heading_Big"><i><u>SICMUTILS Reference Manual</u></i></h1>
    <p>This is a description of the <span class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span>
      computer algebra system, a port to <span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span>
      of <span class="TechEmphasis">scmutils</span>, the <span class="TechEmphasis">MIT-Scheme</span>
      system devised and used by Gerry Sussman and others at MIT, to teach
      advanced mechanics from a computing perspective.&nbsp; The landmark book
      which introduced these ideas is <a title="SICM book" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm/book.html"><i>Structure
          and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</i></a> (aka <span class="TechEmphasis">
        SICM</span>), and can be seen as the evolution into physics of the
      era-defining ideas first presented in <i><a title="SICP book" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs">Structure
          and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> </i>(aka <span class="TechEmphasis">
        SICP</span>).</p>
    <p>Following the <span class="TechEmphasis">scmutils</span> paradigm, <span
        class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span> is an integrated library of
      procedures, embedded in the programming language <em>Clojure</em>,&nbsp;
      intended to support teaching and research in mathematical physics and
      electrical engineering. <span class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span> and <em>Clojure</em>
      are particularly effective in work where the functional nature of <em>Clojure</em>
      is advantageous (such as classical mechanics, among others) where many of
      the procedures are most easily formulated as quite abstract manipulations
      of functions.</p>
    <p>One issue that was holding back the uptake of this system was its
      reliance on a non-portable feature of <em>MIT-Scheme</em>, for which <em>Clojure</em>
      was able to provide a very capable alternative. This means that <span class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span>
      is now available in a modern, Java-based environment, and thus the whole
      arsenal of Java utilities will be easily available to user. We hope that
      this will prove beneficial and allow the harnessing of many already
      existent tools - especially in visualization - to the educational process
      at hand. </p>
    <p>The <span class="TechEmphasis">scmutils</span> implementation is vast,
      and at this stage only a small subset of it has been ported to <span class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span>.&nbsp;
      The main driving motivation was to get the all code in the <em>SICM</em>
      book up and running, so that it could be used by students.&nbsp; As more
      functionality is added, <span class="em">SICM should become a fairly
        complete elegant computer algebra system (CAS).&nbsp; It also has the
        advantage that it is free software, whereas most of the competing
        heavyweight packages are quite proprietary.</span></p>
    <p>This particular document has followed the form of the original <span class="TechEmphasis">scmutils</span>
      <em>Reference Manual</em> quite closely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though a lot of
      changes have been made of necessity, either due to language differences or
      to incompleteness, the chapter structure has been retained.&nbsp; The
      original manual can be found <a title="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/refman.txt"
        href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/refman.txt">here</a>.&nbsp;
      The full scmutils distribution can be found <a title="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/linux-install.htm"
        href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/linux-install.htm">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Many people contributed to the development of the <span class="TechEmphasis">scmutils</span>
      library over many years and you can find their names on the original
      manual already mentioned. <span class="TechEmphasis">SICMutils</span> is
      due to the work and inspiration of Colin Smith. It is available via GitHub
      at <a title="SICMutils source" href="https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils">[littleredcomputer/sicmutils]</a>.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm" align="justify"><font color="#ee2020">Please
        note that if you have been already using <strong> <em>scmutils</em></strong>
        on MIT-Scheme, you will find that there are some small but significant
        differences with this system – due to language idiosyncrasies - which
        could lead to potential ‘gotchas’. Reading through this document should
        make those differences clear.</font> </p>
