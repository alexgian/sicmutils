    <h1 class="Heading_Big">Clojure and Functional Programming</h1>
    <p><span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span> is a computer language in the <span
        class="TechEmphasis">Lisp</span> family of languages, strongly
      influenced by ideas from the language <span class="TechEmphasis">Scheme</span>,
      and designed to run on Virtual Machines, so that it is independent of
      underlying hardware. &nbsp;<span class="T15">The commonest VM environment
        on which <span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span> runs is Java.&nbsp;
      </span>We will make no attempt to document <span class="TechEmphasis"><span
          class="T15">Clojure</span></span> here, <span class="T15">that is a
        mammoth task already undertaken by others, although some useful
        references for beginners are listed at the bottom of this page.</span></p>
    <p>We assume that a reader of this document is familiar with <span class="TechEmphasis">Scheme</span>-like
      dialects and is at least somewhat conversant with ideas like those in</p>
    <p class="IndentedBanner"> Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie
      Sussman<br>
      <b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</b><br>
      MIT Press and McGraw-Hill (1985, 1996) </p>
    <p>Alternatively a fair grounding in the essentials of functional
      programming, either through a language like <span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span>,
      or other functional languages like <span class="TechEmphasis">Haskell</span>
      or <span class="TechEmphasis">ML</span> will probably be sufficient.</p>
    <p> As a reminder, <span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span> is an
      expression-oriented language.&nbsp; Expressions have values.&nbsp; The
      value of an expression is constructed from the values of the constituent
      parts of the expression and the way the expression is constructed.&nbsp;
      Thus, the value of</p>
    <p class="IndentedCode"> (+ (* pi (square r)) 1)</p>
    <p> is constructed from the values of the symbols</p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">+, *, pi, square, r, 1</p>
    <p> and by the parenthetical organization.</p>
    <p> In any <span class="TechEmphasis">Lisp</span>-based language, an
      expression is constructed from parts with parentheses.&nbsp; <span class="TechEmphasis">Clojure</span>
      enriches the options by introducing other delimiters too, e.g. [] for
      vectors, for function arguments and for let statements.&nbsp; This often
      simplifies the reading of the code, but the general idea continues to
      apply all the same.&nbsp; <span class="SlightlySmaller">(See the caveat
        below.)</span></p>
    <p> The first subexpression always denotes a procedure and the rest of the
      subexpressions denote arguments.&nbsp; So in the case of the expression
      above, "square" is a symbol whose value is a procedure that is applied to
      a thing (probably a number) denoted by "r".&nbsp; That value of the
      application of square to r is then combined with the number denoted by
      "pi" using the procedure denoted by "*" to make an object (again probably
      a number) that is combined with the number denoted by "1" using the
      procedure denoted by "+".&nbsp; Indeed, if the symbols have the values we
      expect from their (hopefully mnemonic) names,</p>
    <table style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.5cm ; margin-left: 1cm;" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="IndentedCode" style="width:10%;">&nbsp;+<br>
            &nbsp;*<br>
            &nbsp;pi<br>
            &nbsp;square<br>
            &nbsp;1<br>
            &nbsp;r</td>
          <td class="IndentedCode">&nbsp; =&nbsp; a means of addition<br>
            &nbsp; =&nbsp; a means of multiplication<br>
            &nbsp; =&nbsp; a number approximately equal to 3.14159265358979<br>
            &nbsp; =&nbsp; a means of squaring<br>
            &nbsp; =&nbsp; the multiplicative identity in the reals<br>
            &nbsp; =&nbsp; some given number, say for example 4</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> then the expression given above <span class="InlineCode">(+ (* pi
        (square r)) 1)</span> would have the approximate value denoted by the
      numeral <span class="InlineCode">51.26548245743669</span>. </p>
    <p> We can write expressions denoting procedures.&nbsp; For example the
      procedure for squaring can be written<br>
    </p>
    <p class="IndentedCode"> (fn [x] (* x x)) </p>
    <p> which may be read </p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">"the procedure of one argument x that multiplies x
      by x"</p>
    <p> We may bind a symbol to a value by definition </p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))</p>
    <p> or equivalently, by </p>
    <p class="IndentedCode"> (defn square [x] (* x x))</p>
    <p> The application of a defined procedure to operands will bind the symbols
      that are the formal parameters to the actual arguments that are the values
      of the operands: </p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">(+ (square 3) (square 4)) ==&gt; 25</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2pt"><br>
    </p>
    <p><span class="StandardSans"><font color="#ee2020"><b>One caveat:</b></font></span>
      From the above, it is apparent that previous users of <span class="TechEmphasis">
        scmutils</span>, or <span class="TechEmphasis"> Scheme</span> in
      general, will be able to execute code from <span class="TechEmphasis">
        SICM</span> without needing to alter anything, as the syntax is the
      same.&nbsp; This, however, does not apply when needing to define
      functions, as the syntax here is different.&nbsp; The difference is very
      small however, and should be easily grasped.</p>
    <p>Further, the syntactic sugar available to some <span class="TechEmphasis">
        Scheme</span>s, which allows the following to be written</p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">(define (((somefunc x y) z) w) (+ x y z w)</p>
    <p>is not accommodated in <span class="TechEmphasis"> Clojure</span>, and
      the expression has to be entered in full, as it would be in Scheme:</p>
    <table style="width: 100% ; margin-bottom: 0.5cm ; margin-left: 1cm" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr class="TechEmphasis">
          <td><span class="SlightlySmaller"><u>Clojure</u></span></td>
          <td><span class="SlightlySmaller"><u>Scheme</u></span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="IndentedCode"> (defn somefunc [x y]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; (fn [z]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (fn [w]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (+ x y z w))))<br>
          </td>
          <td class="IndentedCode">(define (somefunc x y)<br>
            &nbsp; (lambda (z)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (lambda (w)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (+ x y z w))))</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Of course, in both cases this is evaluated as</p>
    <p class="IndentedCode">(((somefunc 1 2) 3) 4)&nbsp; ==&gt; 10</p>
    <p style="font-size: 2pt"><br>
